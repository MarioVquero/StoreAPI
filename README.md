# Store API

Hello there this is a project that as of writing this im still working on 
based off of the tutorial by: [John Smilga](https://youtu.be/qwfE7fSVaZM?si=4omuM_a-vnoJ0x_t&t=11300)



Will have this saved somewhere else
[Mongoose Docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)


Considering most of this project is made using the tutorial once complete ill attempt to add more features for the sake of not following the tutorial and leaving the project without adding anything.

Changes I plan to make
<ul>
    <li>nothing at the moment just started</li>
</ul>


going to list the files I can't take credit for as well since it was given for the tutorial
<ul>
    <li>package.json</li>
    <li>gitignore file ( will probably add on to this theres only 2 lines)</li>
    <li>Everything in the public folder as of writing this</li>
</ul>



Reminders and Notices for me
<ul>
    <li>nothing at the  moment</li>
</ul>
